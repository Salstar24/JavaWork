*Instance variables* (the data that the class KNOWS about itself)

DECLARE an int array to hold the location cells. Call it locationCells.
DECLARE an int to hold the number of hits made. Call it numOfHits and SET (assign) it to 0.

-----

*Method declarations* (their names, and WHY they need to be here)

DECLARE a checkYourself() method that takes a String argument in its parameter for the user's guess (a number), checks it, and returns a result representing a hit, miss, or kill.
DECLARE a setLocationCells() setter method that takes an int array (which has the three cell locations as ints).

-----

*Method logic* (what has to happen (the how will be when we turn it into real code))

String checkYourself(String userGuess)
	GET the user guess as a String parameter
	CONVERT the user guess to an int
	REPEAT the following with each of the location cells in the int array 
		COMPARE the user guess to the location cell
		IF the user guess matches
			INCREMENT the number of hits
			FIND OUT if it was the last location cell:
				IF numOfHits is 3, RETURN 'kill' as the result
				ELSE it was not a kill, so RETURN 'hit'
				END IF
		ELSE the user's guess did not match, so RETURN 'miss'
		END IF
	END REPEAT
END METHOD

void setLocationCells(int[] cell Locations)
	GET the cell locations as an int array parameter
	ASSIGN the cell locations parameter to the cell locations instance variable
END METHOD
